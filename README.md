# Image-cartoonifier
In this project, we build a interesting application that will cartoonify the image provided to it. To build this cartoonifyer application we will use python and OpenCV. This is one of the exciting and thrilling applications of Machine Learning. While building this application we will also see how to use libraries like easygui, Tkinter, and all. Here you have to select the image and then the application will convert that image into its cartoon form. Mainly, we build this application using OpenCV and Python as the programming languages.
